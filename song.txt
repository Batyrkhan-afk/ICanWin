Okay, she keep cryin', she keep cryin' every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my

  Redbone 

So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishin' I could make this mine, oh

(You can have it) oh, oh, oh
(If you need it) ooh
(We can make it, oh)
If you want it
You can have it

But stay woke, niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh
Now stay woke, niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes
